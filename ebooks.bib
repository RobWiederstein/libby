	abstract = {This article presents a systematic review of E-book user studies from 2001 to 2017. It focused on qualitative and quantitative studies that examined academic user groups’ attitudes and interactions with E-books. The review aimed to reveal users’ knowledge of the E-book format, their ability to define an E-book, their awareness of E-books’ availabilities from the institutions’ libraries, as well as their appreciation of E-books’ advantages. The authors also considered respondents’ usage of E-books such as the devices that fostered E-book access, internet avenues individuals’ utilized to locate the materials, printing and downloading of E-books, and the time individuals’ spent reading E-books online and the frequency of their access. The literature illustrated the importance of E-books to all members of the academic community for research and coursework. Still, studies pointed to a lack of awareness or familiarity among students, faculty, and staff of their institution’s E-books especially with the format’s features and the various collections owned by the university. To that end, it is especially critical that librarians promote E-books to all potential users.},

	abstract = {Arriving at a medical diagnosis is a highly complex process that is extremely error prone. Missed or delayed diagnoses often lead to patient harm and missed opportunities for treatment. Since medical imaging is a major contributor to the overall diagnostic process, it is also a major potential source of diagnostic error. Although some diagnoses may be missed because of the technical or physical limitations of the imaging modality, including image resolution, intrinsic or extrinsic contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio, most missed radiologic diagnoses are attributable to image interpretation errors by radiologists. Radiologic interpretation cannot be mechanized or automated; it is a human enterprise based on complex psychophysiologic and cognitive processes and is itself subject to a wide variety of error types, including perceptual errors (those in which an important abnormality is simply not seen on the images) and cognitive errors (those in which the abnormality is visually detected but the meaning or importance of the finding is not correctly understood or appreciated). The overall prevalence of radiologists’ errors in practice does not appear to have changed since it was first estimated in the 1960s. The authors review the epidemiology of errors in diagnostic radiology, including a recently proposed taxonomy of radiologists’ errors, as well as research findings, in an attempt to elucidate possible underlying causes of these errors. The authors also propose strategies for error reduction in radiology. On the basis of current understanding, specific suggestions are offered as to how radiologists can improve their performance in practice.

Noise is especially high in psychiatry, where subjective judgment is obviously important. However, considerable noise is also found in areas where it might not be expected, such as in the reading of X-rays."

Debiasing and Decision Hygiene,52.5%,#FFB,"upshot is that ex post or ex ante debiasing—which, respectively, correct or prevent specific psychological biases—are useful in some situations. These approaches work where the general direction of error is known and manifests itself as a clear statistical bias."

"January 28, 2023 19:29",24. Structure in Hiring,66.8%,#FFB,Why do first impressions end up driving the outcome of a much longer interview?
"January 28, 2023 19:29",24. Structure in Hiring,66.8%,#FFB,"Interviewers with positive first impressions, for instance, ask fewer questions and tend to “sell” the company to the candidate."
"January 28, 2023 19:28",24. Structure in Hiring,66.6%,#FFB,"Most organizations fully expect this variability and, for that reason, require several interviewers to meet the same candidate, with the results aggregated in some way."

"January 28, 2023 19:24",24. Structure in Hiring,66.1%,#FFB,"In essence, if your goal is to determine which candidates will succeed in a job and which will fail, standard interviews (also called unstructured interviews to distinguish them from structured interviews, to which we will turn shortly) are not very informative.
